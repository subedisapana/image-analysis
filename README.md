# Fundamentals of Image Processing
Learning image analysis

## GOAlS:
Helps you to understand the image collected, enabling you to correctly segment images into features of interest in a computer-driven manner.
Additionally, collect accurate and representative measurement the feature of that image.


## Outline:
01. Image Analysis - Use standard techniques to  accurately, reproducibly identify features in your images and measure
02. Clean Images - Remove noise and artifacts
03. Pre-processing Images - Highlight the features you want to find
04. Selecting your Feature - Thresholding and Morphological Techniques
05. Extracting Measuring Features - From resulting Image Segmentations


## Requirements: Options for image analysis software
1. ImageJ
2. OpenCV
3. MIPAR
